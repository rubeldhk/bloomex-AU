                        <p>It's a formula that worked, and still does. Firstly, the company buys products directly from growers and suppliers. This arrangement eliminates the wholesalers (middlemen) from the equation which greatly decreases costs and shorter farm to recipient timelines which provides a much fresher product for you, the customer.</p>

                        <p>The next step was to market, sell and prepare the products through Bloomex's own production facilities. Customers can order flowers and gifts online, on the phone, or through live chat with the Bloomex team of dedicated customer service staff. This ensures a more efficient and professional experience for every order. Having our own production facilities to carefully prepare and send your order means a better product and on time delivery, to more locations coast to coast.</p>
