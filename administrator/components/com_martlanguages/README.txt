--------------------------------------------
Language File Manager for
VirtueMart (formerly known as mambo-phpShop)
Abbrevation: VMLFM
--------------------------------------------

ABOUT
# # # # # # # # # # # #
This component is a tool for everyone who is using VirtueMart and wants to safely maintain
or modify a language file or all language files at once.

INSTALLATION
# # # # # # # # # # # #
As wrote before, this is a component and thus should be installed as every Joomla! component:
just use the component installer and upload the ZIP package file.

WHAT IS THIS GOOD FOR?
# # # # # # # # # # # #
1. This component is a tool for developers, working on VirtueMart!
	Did you ever add a language variable and had to add it to every language
	file manually or using diff scripts?
	Forget that now, this VMLFM cares for that. You just have to add a language "token"
	and a default english value for it and the VMLFM adds it to each available language file.
	Ever wanted to modify a language token like _PHPSHOP_SOME_VERY_LONG_UNREADABLE_VARIABLE_NAME
	to look like _PHPSHOP_A_SHORT_NAME ?
	Just rename that token in the "edit token" form and all language files are updated.
	If you leave a token name empty, it is removed from all language files.
	
2. This component is a tool for store owners...

	Somehow it of course eases the way to modify language strings.
	And it supports you while writing: you don't need to care for XHTML compliance!
	All special characters (e.g. in germany we have those umlauts: ö, ü, ä) are converted
	to their HTML entities when updating the language file.

ANYTHING ELSE?
# # # # # # # # # # # #
Yes.
Do you have a good idea how to improve the work of a Joomla/VirtueMart developer like yourself?
Let us know! If you can code a tool like this one: just do it!
